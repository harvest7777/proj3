# Banker's Algorithm Implementation
## CECS 326 - Operating Systems Project 3

### Team Members
- Ryan Tran
- Phu Quach

### Project Description
This project implements the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance in resource allocation. The program simulates a system with 5 processes and 3 types of resources, demonstrating safe state detection and resource request handling.

### How to Compile and Run

#### Option 1: Run directly with Python
```bash
python main.py
```
or
```bash
python3 main.py
```

From the project directory, run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You’ll see a menu:

```
1. Find safe sequence
2. Request resources
3. Exit
```
