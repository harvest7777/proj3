### Project Description
This project implements the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance in resource allocation. The program simulates a system with 5 processes and 3 types of resources, demonstrating safe state detection and resource request handling.

### How to Compile and Run

#### Option 1: Run directly with Python
```bash
python main.py
```
